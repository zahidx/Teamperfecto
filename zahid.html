                    <p>The research paper titled "Internet of Things (IoT) Based Gas Leakage Monitoring and Alerting System with MQ-2 Sensor" describes the design and implementation of a microcontroller-based gas detection and alerting system. The system is designed to detect hazardous gases like LPG and propane using an MQ-2 sensor and display the gas level on an LCD screen. If the gas level exceeds a certain limit, an alarm is triggered, and an alert message is sent to an authorized person via email through the internet. The system is built using an ARM Cortex-M4 development board and wireless network connectivity. The paper also provides a brief introduction to IoT and its potential impact on various industries and sectors. The literature review includes related research work on intelligent security systems, wireless monitoring systems, and gas sensors for vehicle cabin air quality monitoring. Finally, the paper describes the material properties and design specifications of the ARM Cortex-M4 development board used in the gas leakage monitoring system.</p>
